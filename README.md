___2. What it does:___

The world of code is moving swiftly towards a world of APIs rather than libraries. This includes APis from companies such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo that empower organizations to integrate years of work into their products.

API_GO is a very useful platform gathering existing APIs and providing help to rookie programmers. In this case, some APIs are well-known but many of them are not. Our website can be a convenient tool for developers to search and learn new APIs.
