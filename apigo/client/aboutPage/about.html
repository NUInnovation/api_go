							What the heck is an API?
						</h3>
						<p class="about-content">
							Imagine when you face a very labor-intensive task, like copying your 1K+ Instagram photos to display them on Facebook, you would love to assign this job to a computer who can do it quickly and accurately. The solution is an API. An API is the tool that makes a website's data digestible for a computer. It works as a bridge that through it a computer can view and edit data by itself, just like a person can by loading pages and submitting forms. 
							<i><b>It makes data easier to work.</b></i>
						</p> 
						<p class="about-content">
							What might take one person hours to accomplish costs a computer seconds via an API.

						How could an API work itself?
					</h3>
					<p class="about-content">
						Basically, an API is like a secret code between two systems. The server builds various APIs for developers to use and those APIs won't function without the command from developers.
					</p>
					<p class="about-content">
						Normally, the client site commands the API to fetch data from the server site and the API will do it. It’s pretty much like you tell your roommate to get you a Coke and your mom gets you a Coke. Your roommate here, is an API.

				Lesson 0: Pre-Reading
			</p>
			<p class="faq-content">
				Before we start learning how to use an API, there are a few things to know. Learning how to use APIs requires dedication and resolve. It requires a willingness to fail early and often. For sure, it requires adopting an entirely new world view, thinking about information as data that can be collected.

				Lesson 1: What Are APIs and How Do They Work?
			</p>
				
			<p class="faq-content">1. Install cygwin.</p>
			<p class="faq-content">2. Use setup.exe in the cygwin folder to install the following packages: devel → openssl. devel → g++-gcc. devel → make. python → python. devel → git.</p>
			<p class="faq-content">3. Open the cygwin command line with Start > Cygwin > Cygwin Bash Shell .</p>
			<p class="faq-content">4. Run the below commands to download and build node.</p>
				
			<p class="faq-title">				
				Lesson 2: what is a curl request?
			</p>
			<p class="faq-content">
				curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction.

curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin!
