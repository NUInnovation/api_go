							What the heck is an API?
						</h3>
						<p class="about-content">
							Imagine when you face a very labor-intensive task, like copying your 1K+ Instagram photos to display them on Facebook, you would love to assign this job to a computer who can do it quickly and accurately. The solution is an API. An API is the tool that makes a website's data digestible for a computer. It works as a bridge that through it a computer can view and edit data by itself, just like a person can by loading pages and submitting forms. 
						</p>
						<p class="about-quotes">
							<i>It makes data easier to work.</i>
						</p> 
						<p class="about-content">
							What might take one person hours to accomplish takes a computer seconds with APIs.

					How could API work itself?
				</h3>
				<p class="about-content">
					Basically, an API is like a secret code between two systems. The server builds various APIs for developers to use and those APIs won't function without the command from developers.
				</p>
				<p class="about-content">
					Normally, the client site commands the API to fetch data from the server site and the API will do it. Itâ€™s pretty much like you tell your roommate to get you a Coke and your mom gets you a Coke. Your roommate here, is an API.

				Before we start learning how to use an API, there are a few things to know. Learning how to use APIs requires dedication and resolve. It requires a willingness to fail early and often.
